How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Compared the two files and showed the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It allows me to see a pattern of errors that I have made in the past

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you can save offline, a lot more organized
    Cons: wont save automatically, harder to get used to

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It allows easy organization, and we can compare commits easier for grouped
    files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    using git log to see all past commits then using git diff to compare two
    past commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You could compare errors and see where it started

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
